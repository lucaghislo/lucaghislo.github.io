  abstract = {GAPS (General AntiParticle Spectrometer) is a stratospheric balloon experiment designed to detect low-energy cosmic ray antinuclei (<0.25 GeV) as an indirect signature of dark matter. The experiment exploits an innovative particle identification approach based on the formation of an excited atom and its consequent de-excitation and decay. GAPS will provide unprecedented sensitivity to cosmic antideuterons, an antiproton spectrum in a hitherto unexplored energy range and high sensitivity to cosmic antihelium. The first flight is foreseen to take place from the McMurdo Station in Antarctica during the austral summer of 2024. The instrument is currently undergoing integration and calibration in anticipation of launch. In this paper, the latest tracker electronics energy threshold calibration results will be presented.},

for an indirect signature of dark matter through the detection of low-energy (<0.25 GeV/n) cosmic-ray antiprotons, antideuterons

responsible for defining channel settings and for sending digital information to the data acquisition system. The core of the ASIC is
a low-noise analog channel implementing a dynamic signal compression which makes the chip suitable for resolving both X-rays in
the range of 20 to 100 keV and charged particles with energy deposition of up to 100 MeV. It features an energy resolution of 4 keV
FWHM in the 20-100 keV range with a 40 pF detector capacitance, to clearly distinguish X-rays from antiprotonic or antideuteronic
exotic atoms. The readout electronics of the ASIC will run at a temperature of about -40 â—¦C, complying with a detector leakage
current of the order of 5-10 nA per strip.},

  abstract = {The General Anti Particle Spectrometer (GAPS) is a balloon-borne cosmic-ray experiment which
is currently in its last phase of construction, undergoing system testing, and scheduled for a longduration
balloon flight from McMurdo Station in the Antarctic in December 2024. Its primary
scientific goal is the search for light antinuclei in cosmic rays at kinetic energies below 0.25 GeV/n.
This energy region is especially of interest for beyond-the-standard model dark matter searches and
is still mostly uncharted. Searches for light antimatter nuclei with energies below 0.25 GeV/n are
a novel approach to the search for dark matter because wide range of dark matter models proposes
annihilation or decay into matter-antimatter pairs. GAPS will yield unprecedented sensitivity to
low-energy antideuterons and will measure the low-energy antiproton spectrum with high statistics
and precision. To reach the required sensitivity, the GAPS detector incorporates a new approach
for antimatter detection, utilizing a tracker with custom, lithium-drifted silicon detectors, designed
to measure the X-ray cascade expected from antimatter capture and charged particles from the
subsequent annihilation. It also utilizes a fast time-of-flight system, allowing for a high-precision
beta measurement. This proceeding highlights GAPS scientific goals.}

  abstract  = {Light and active mobility, as well as multimodal mobility, could significantly contribute to decarbonization. Air quality is a key parameter to monitor the environment in terms of health and leisure benefits. In a possible scenario, wearables and recharge stations could supply information about a distributed monitoring system of air quality. The availability of low-power, smart, low-cost, compact embedded systems, such as Arduino Nicla Sense ME, based on BME688 by Bosch, Reutlingen, Germany, and powered by suitable software tools, can provide the hardware to be easily integrated into wearables as well as in solar-powered EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) for scooters and e-bikes. In this way, each e-vehicle, bike, or EVSE can contribute to a distributed monitoring network providing real-time information about micro-climate and pollution. This work experimentally investigates the capability of the BME688 environmental sensor to provide useful and detailed information about air quality. Initial experimental results from measurements in non-controlled and controlled environments show that BME688 is suited to detect the human-perceived air quality. CO2 readout can also be significant for other gas (e.g., CO), while IAQ (Index for Air Quality, from 0 to 500) is heavily affected by relative humidity, and its significance below 250 is quite low for an outdoor uncontrolled environment.},
