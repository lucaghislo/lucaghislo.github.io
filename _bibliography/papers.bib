	abstract = {GAPS (General AntiParticle Spectrometer) is a stratospheric balloon experiment designed to detect low-energy cosmic ray antinuclei ( \$ \&lt;0.25\$ GeV) as an indirect signature of dark matter. The experiment exploits an innovative particle identification approach based on the formation of an excited atom and its consequent de-excitation and decay. GAPS will provide unprecedented sensitivity to cosmic antideuterons, an antiproton spectrum in a hitherto unexplored energy range and high sensitivity to cosmic antihelium. The first flight is foreseen to take place from the McMurdo Station in Antarctica during the austral summer of 2024. The instrument is currently undergoing integration and calibration in anticipation of launch. In this paper, the latest tracker electronics energy threshold calibration results will be presented.},

	abstract = {Light and active mobility, as well as multimodal mobility, could significantly contribute to decarbonization. Air quality is a key parameter to monitor the environment in terms of health and leisure benefits. In a possible scenario, wearables and recharge stations could supply information about a distributed monitoring system of air quality. The availability of low-power, smart, low-cost, compact embedded systems, such as Arduino Nicla Sense ME, based on BME688 by Bosch, Reutlingen, Germany, and powered by suitable software tools, can provide the hardware to be easily integrated into wearables as well as in solar-powered EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) for scooters and e-bikes. In this way, each e-vehicle, bike, or EVSE can contribute to a distributed monitoring network providing real-time information about micro-climate and pollution. This work experimentally investigates the capability of the BME688 environmental sensor to provide useful and detailed information about air quality. Initial experimental results from measurements in non-controlled and controlled environments show that BME688 is suited to detect the human-perceived air quality. CO2 readout can also be significant for other gas (e.g., CO), while IAQ (Index for Air Quality, from 0 to 500) is heavily affected by relative humidity, and its significance below 250 is quite low for an outdoor uncontrolled environment.},

A novel solution using dynamic threshold MOSFETs for the non-linear feedback capacitor implementation has been investigated. The paper will discuss the amplifier architecture, with a focus on the input and feedback device design and the relevant simulation results.},

This data acquisition module supports multi-protocol communication interfaces and it can aggregate data about the environment, the status of the vehicle and the user. Moreover, it can support the integration with an IoT communication infrastructure. A prototype of the system has been implemented to prove the feasibility of the architecture.},

	abstract = {Active mobility and light vehicles, such as e-bikes, are gaining increasing attention as sustainable transportation alternatives to internal combustion solutions. In this context, collecting comprehensive data on environmental conditions, vehicle performance, and user interaction is crucial for improving system efficiency and user experience. This paper presents a data acquisition system designed to collect data from multiple sensor platforms. The architecture is optimized to maintain low power consumption and operate within limited computational resources, making it suitable for real-time data acquisition on light vehicles. To achieve this, a data acquisition module was developed using a single-board computer integrated with a custom shield, which also captures data related to the assistance of an e-bike motor through a wireless interface. The paper provides an in-depth discussion of the architecture and software development, along with a detailed overview of the sensors used. A demonstrator was created to verify the system architecture idea and prove the potentialities of the system overall. The demonstrator has been qualified by professional and semi-professional riders in the framework of the Giro-E, a cyclist event which took place in May 2024, on the same roads of the Giro d’Italia. Finally, some preliminary analyses on the data acquired are provided to show the performance of the system, particularly in reconstructing the user behavior, the environmental parameters, and the type of road.},
