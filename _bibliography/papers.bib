  abstract = {GAPS (General AntiParticle Spectrometer) is a stratospheric balloon experiment designed to detect low-energy cosmic ray antinuclei (<0.25 GeV) as an indirect signature of dark matter. The experiment exploits an innovative particle identification approach based on the formation of an excited atom and its consequent de-excitation and decay. GAPS will provide unprecedented sensitivity to cosmic antideuterons, an antiproton spectrum in a hitherto unexplored energy range and high sensitivity to cosmic antihelium. The first flight is foreseen to take place from the McMurdo Station in Antarctica during the austral summer of 2024. The instrument is currently undergoing integration and calibration in anticipation of launch. In this paper, the latest tracker electronics energy threshold calibration results will be presented.},

  abstract = {Light and active mobility, as well as multimodal mobility, could significantly contribute to decarbonization. Air quality is a key parameter to monitor the environment in terms of health and leisure benefits. In a possible scenario, wearables and recharge stations could supply information about a distributed monitoring system of air quality. The availability of low-power, smart, low-cost, compact embedded systems, such as Arduino Nicla Sense ME, based on BME688 by Bosch, Reutlingen, Germany, and powered by suitable software tools, can provide the hardware to be easily integrated into wearables as well as in solar-powered EVSE (Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment) for scooters and e-bikes. In this way, each e-vehicle, bike, or EVSE can contribute to a distributed monitoring network providing real-time information about micro-climate and pollution. This work experimentally investigates the capability of the BME688 environmental sensor to provide useful and detailed information about air quality. Initial experimental results from measurements in non-controlled and controlled environments show that BME688 is suited to detect the human-perceived air quality. CO2 readout can also be significant for other gas (e.g., CO), while IAQ (Index for Air Quality, from 0 to 500) is heavily affected by relative humidity, and its significance below 250 is quite low for an outdoor uncontrolled environment.},

In this context, collecting comprehensive data on environmental conditions, vehicle performance, and user interaction is crucial for improving system efficiency and user experience. This paper presents a data acquisition system designed to collect data from multiple sensor platforms. The architecture is optimized to maintain low power consumption and operate within limited computational resources, making it suitable for real-time data acquisition on light vehicles. To achieve this, a data acquisition module was developed using a single-board computer integrated with a custom shield, which also captures data related to the assistance of an e-bike motor through a wireless interface. The paper provides an in-depth discussion of the architecture and software development, along with a detailed overview of the sensors used. A demonstrator was created to verify the system architecture idea and prove the potentialities of the system overall. The demonstrator has been qualified by professional and semi-professional riders in the framework of the Giro-E, a cyclist event which took place in May 2024, on the same roads of the Giro d’Italia. Finally, some preliminary analyses on the data acquired are provided to show the performance of the system, particularly in reconstructing the user behavior, the environmental parameters, and the type of road.},

  abstract = {With its inaugural Antarctic long-duration balloon mission in December 2023, the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) will become the first experiment optimized to detect cosmic-ray antinuclei below 0.25 GeV/n. Detection of a single antideuteron at this energy scale would be a smoking-gun signature of new physics such as dark matter. The GAPS program will also provide a precision antiproton spectrum in a previously unprobed low-energy range, as well as leading sensitivity to antihelium-3. This new parameter space is accessible thanks to a novel particle identification method based on exotic atom formation, de-excitation, and decay. The method provides a unique handle for the negatively-charged antinuclei, facilitating excellent rejection of the positive-nucleus background, and does not require a magnet, enabling a large sensitive area for rare events. The GAPS instrument is designed to provide excellent discrimination power for rare events within the power and mass constraints of a long-duration balloon. The time-of-flight, composed of 160 scintillator paddles, provides the system trigger as well as the GAPS energy scale. The 2.5 m3 tracker volume is instrumented with 1000 10-cm-diameter silicon sensors which serve as the target, X-ray spectrometer, and particle tracker. Together, a large-area radiator and an integrated oscillating heat pipe system cool the payload without a bulky cryostat. This contribution reports the integration and calibration of the GAPS science payload, including the performance of the sensitive detector subsystems, the cooling system, the power distribution, and data acquisition and onboard event processing.},

  abstract = {GAPS (General AntiParticle Spectrometer) is a balloon-borne large-acceptance experiment designed to detect low-energy (<0.25 GeV/n) cosmic-ray antinuclei during three ~35-day Antarctic flights, the first of these planned for the 2024-2025 austral summer. The GAPS apparatus, currently in preparation for the first flight, consists of a tracker equipped with large-area lithium-drifted silicon detectors and surrounded by a large-acceptance time-of-flight system made of plastic scintillators. This design has been optimized to perform a novel antiparticle identification technique based on an antinucleus capture and the subsequent exotic atom formation and decay, allowing more active target material and a larger geometrical acceptance since no magnet is required. Although detecting the cosmic-ray antinuclei as an indirect dark-matter signature is the primary goal of GAPS, many low-energy cosmic-ray nuclei will also be recorded. Nuclei do not form exotic atoms in the GAPS detectors, and their detection is based on the measurements of the ionization energy depositions and the evaluation of the kinetic energy and the stopping depth relative to the measured velocity. An algorithm was developed to fit the slow-down of particles and antiparticles tracked inside the GAPS apparatus. The quantities fitted by this algorithm, together with the measured velocity and energy deposition information, allow the identification of protons, deuterons, and helium nuclei and the measurement of their spectra in a low-energy range (< 0.25 GeV/n). The results of this analysis, based on detailed Monte Carlo simulation studies, will be presented in this contribution.},

  abstract = {The General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) Antarctic long duration balloon mission is scheduled for launch during the austral summer of 2024-25. Its novel detection technique, based on exotic atom formation, excitation, and decay, is specifically designed for the detection of slow moving cosmic antiprotons and antideuterons. Such antinuclei are predicted by a wide variety of allowed dark matter models, as well as other astrophysical theories like primordial black holes. There are two main components of the GAPS instrument: a large-area tracker and a surrounding time-of-flight system (TOF). The combination of these two systems allows GAPS to effectively differentiate between species of negatively-charged antinuclei and determine the energy deposition, velocity, and trajectory of particles interacting with the detector. This contribution will focus on the TOF, which determines the velocity of the incoming antiparticle and provides the trigger to the experiment. We will give an overview of the TOF detector, an explanation of relevant electronics, and a report on its construction and preliminary performance. The TOF is composed of 160 thin plastic scintillator paddles ranging in length from 1.5 to 1.8 meters. At each paddle end, signals from six silicon photomultipliers are combined to produce two copies of the resulting waveform: one to form the trigger and one for data readout. This design is optimized for low mass and fast data acquisition while still maintaining good light collection.},

  abstract = {The General Anti Particle Spectrometer (GAPS) is a balloon-borne cosmic-ray experiment which is currently in its last phase of construction, undergoing system testing, and scheduled for a long-duration balloon flight from McMurdo Station in the Antarctic in December 2024. Its primary scientific goal is the search for light antinuclei in cosmic rays at kinetic energies below 0.25 GeV/n. This energy region is especially of interest for beyond-the-standard model dark matter searches and is still mostly uncharted. Searches for light antimatter nuclei with energies below ~0.25 GeV/n are a novel approach to the search for dark matter because wide range of dark matter models proposes annihilation or decay into matter-antimatter pairs. GAPS will yield unprecedented sensitivity to low-energy antideuterons and will measure the low-energy antiproton spectrum with high statistics and precision. To reach the required sensitivity, the GAPS detector incorporates a new approach for antimatter detection, utilizing a tracker with custom, lithium-drifted silicon detectors, designed to measure the X-ray cascade expected from antimatter capture and charged particles from the subsequent annihilation. It also utilizes a fast time-of-flight system, allowing for a high-precision beta measurement. This proceeding highlights GAPS scientific goals.},

  abstract = {The General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) is a balloon-borne experiment designed to perform low-energy cosmic-ray antinuclei measurements to search for indirect signatures of dark matter annihilation or decay. A wide range of well-motivated dark matter models predicts antinuclei fluxes about two orders of magnitude above the expected astrophysical background below 250 MeV/n. The study of this unexplored low-energy region allows GAPS to achieve an unprecedented sensitivity for antideuteron and antihelium nuclei fluxes. GAPS will collect high statistics of low-energy antiprotons, extending the measurement of the antiproton spectrum to the unexplored region below 100 MeV. The GAPS experiment will perform three long-duration balloon flights over Antarctica, the first of which is planned for the 2024/2025 austral summer. The experimental apparatus consists of a Si(Li) tracker surrounded by a time-of-flight system made of plastic scintillator paddles. GAPS uses a novel identification technique based on the formation of an exotic atom and its de-excitation and decay. This contribution first illustrates the scientific potential of the GAPS experiment and its impact on indirect dark matter searches. It then describes the experimental apparatus and the detection technique exploited to identify antinuclei events. The expected sensitivity for antinuclei, based on detailed instrument simulations, is discussed. Finally, the status of payload integration and testing before the first flight is summarized.},

  abstract = {The General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS) experiment aims to elucidate the nature of dark matter by detecting low-energy antinuclei using a long-duration scientific balloon over Antarctica. The GAPS detector consists of a tracker made of lithium-drifted silicon detectors, surrounded by two layers of time-of-flight (TOF) plastic scintillators. To achieve an energy resolution of 4 keV FWHM in the 20--100 keV range, the silicon detectors are cooled to -40 °C using multi-loop capillary heat pipes (MCHPs), specifically developed for GAPS. The MCHPs transport heat from the detectors to a radiator attached to the payload's sidewall. On the ground, the radiator is directly cooled by the Ground Cooling System (GCS) to enable detector testing. The GCS consists of a chiller, a cold plate, and insulating foam. GAPS completed successful instrument commissioning during the past Antarctic launch season. During this period, we conducted cooling tests to investigate the detector performance using the GCS. Unfortunately, GAPS was not able to launch in the past season due to weather. GAPS remains assembled at the LDB site and stands ready for its first scientific balloon flight in the austral summer of 2025–2026. This contribution presents the results of the ground tests conducted during the 2024/25 season, with a particular focus on the performance of the cooling system.},

  abstract = {GAPS is a long-duration balloon experiment designed to measure the flux of low-energy (<0.25 GeV/n) cosmic antinuclei as signatures of dark matter. Many well-motivated theories for dark matter predict annihilation or decay channels that can produce final state hadrons which may include antiprotons and antineutrons that may coalesce to form low-energy antideuterons or antihelium. The background for complex antinuclei from standard astrophysical sources is orders of magnitude below the predicted flux from viable dark matter candidates at the low-energy range for which GAPS is optimized. The GAPS instrument is currently assembled in Antarctica and stands ready for its first flight during the December 2025/January 2026 launch season. This proceeding covers the anticipated science impact GAPS will have on the current landscape of cosmic antinuclei measurements as well as the instrument design and novel detection technique employed by the experiment.},

Over the course of at least three long-duration flights over Antarctica, it will explore the sub-250 MeV/n energy range with sensitivity to antideuterons and antihelium, while also extending antiproton measurements below 100 MeV. The instrument features a tracker built from more than one thousand lithium-drifted silicon detectors, each read out by a dedicated custom integrated circuit.

It integrates eight independent analog channels, each incorporating a low-noise charge-sensitive amplifier with dynamic signal compression, a CR--RC shaping stage with eight selectable peaking times, and on-chip calibration circuitry. The charge-sensitive amplifier uses metal-oxide semiconductor feedback elements with voltage-dependent capacitance to support the wide input energy range from 10 keV to 100 MeV. Four alternative feedback implementations are included to compare performance and design trade-offs. Leakage current compensation up to 200 nA per detector strip is provided by a Krummenacher current-feedback network.

  abstract = {This work presents the design and characterization of a radiation-hardened bandgap voltage reference circuit fabricated using a commercial 28 nm CMOS technology for applications in high-energy physics experiments. The circuit was engineered to ensure stable performance under extreme radiation environments and wide temperature variations. Measurement results show a temperature coefficient of 11 ppm/°C at best over a temperature range of 100 °C (from −40 °C to 60 °C) and a line regulation of 2.5 mV at room temperature. The mean value of the output voltage is around 480 mV, with a maximum variation of 2% when exposed to a total ionizing dose of up to 1 Grad (SiO₂). The power consumption is 325 µW at room temperature, and the circuit operates correctly with a supply voltage ranging from 0.65 V to 1 V. The core area of the bandgap reference is 0.015 mm². These results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed design for use in extreme radiation environments.},
