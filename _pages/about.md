I’m a Computer Engineer and a Ph.D. student in microelectronics for high energy physics at the [Microelectronics Laboratory](https://microlab-unibg.it/#/home) of the University of Bergamo. I also work as a technologist at the National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN, Pavia section) and as Research Associate II at the Astrophysics Laboratory of Columbia University in New York.

My research is concerned with the development and characterization of integrated circuits for the readout of silicon-strip detectors employed in high energy physics and astrophysics experiments.

I’m currently involved in the development of the [General AntiParticle Spectrometer](https://gaps1.astro.ucla.edu/gaps/index.html) (GAPS) experiment in search of dark matter.
