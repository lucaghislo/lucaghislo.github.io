I am a Computer Engineer and Ph.D. student in microelectronics for high-energy physics at the [Microelectronics Laboratory](https://microlab-unibg.it/#/home), Department of Engineering and Applied Sciences, [University of Bergamo](https://en.unibg.it/). I also work as a technologist at the Pavia branch of the Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics ([INFN](https://home.infn.it/en/)), within the CSN2 particle physics division. Previously, I was an associate research fellow at the Columbia Astrophysics Laboratory (CAL) of Columbia University.  

My research is centered on the design and characterization of analog integrated circuits for the readout of silicon-strip detectors used in high-energy physics and astrophysics experiments. These systems are critical for advancing our understanding of fundamental particles and cosmic phenomena.  

Currently, I contribute to the [General AntiParticle Spectrometer](https://gaps1.astro.ucla.edu/gaps/index.html) (GAPS), a NASA‚ÄìJAXA‚ÄìINFN‚ÄìASI balloon experiment in Antarctica. GAPS is designed to perform the first sensitive search for low-energy cosmic-ray antideuterons, as well as precise measurements of antiprotons and antihelium, providing a unique indirect probe of dark matter.  

üèîÔ∏è Outside the lab, I enjoy exploring the mountains ‚Äî you can find some of my hikes on [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/it-it/user/4059073076208).
