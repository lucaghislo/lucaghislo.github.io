I am a Computer Engineer and a Ph.D. student in microelectronics for high-energy physics at the [Microelectronics Laboratory](https://microlab-unibg.it/#/home) in the Department of Engineering and Applied Sciences at the [University of Bergamo](https://en.unibg.it/). I work as a technologist at the Pavia branch of the Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics ([INFN](https://home.infn.it/en/)) within the CSN2 particle physics division, and I previously served as an associate research fellow at the Columbia Astrophysics Laboratory (CAL) of Columbia University.

My research focuses on the design and characterization of analog integrated circuits for the readout of silicon-strip detectors employed in high energy physics and astrophysics experiments.

I am currently contributing to the development of the [General AntiParticle Spectrometer](https://gaps1.astro.ucla.edu/gaps/index.html) (GAPS) Antarctic balloon experiment as part of the GAPS collaboration. GAPS is a NASA, JAXA, INFN and ASI experiment that is designed to precisely measure the flux of low-energy cosmic-ray antideuterons, antiprotons, and antihelium as an indirect signature of dark matter.
