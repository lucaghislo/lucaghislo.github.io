<!-- I am a Computer Engineer and Ph.D. student in microelectronics for high-energy physics at the [Microelectronics Laboratory](https://microlab-unibg.it/#/home), Department of Engineering and Applied Sciences, [University of Bergamo](https://en.unibg.it/). I also work as a technologist at the Pavia branch of the Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics ([INFN](https://home.infn.it/en/)), within the CSN2 particle physics division. Previously, I was an associate research fellow at the Columbia Astrophysics Laboratory (CAL) of Columbia University.  

My research is centered on the design and characterization of analog integrated circuits for the readout of silicon-strip detectors used in high-energy physics and astrophysics experiments. These systems are critical for advancing our understanding of fundamental particles and cosmic phenomena.  

Currently, I contribute to the [General AntiParticle Spectrometer](https://gaps1.astro.ucla.edu/gaps/index.html) (GAPS), a NASA–JAXA–INFN–ASI balloon experiment in Antarctica. GAPS is designed to perform the first sensitive search for low-energy cosmic-ray antideuterons, as well as precise measurements of antiprotons and antihelium, providing a unique indirect probe of dark matter.   -->

I am a Computer Engineer and Research Fellow at the Pavia branch of the Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics ([INFN – Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare](https://home.infn.it/en/)), working within the CSN2 particle physics division. I obtained my Ph.D. in *Engineering and Applied Sciences (Microelectronics for High-Energy Physics)* at the [Microelectronics Laboratory](https://microlab-unibg.it/#/home), Department of Engineering and Applied Sciences, [University of Bergamo](https://en.unibg.it/).

My research focuses on the design and characterization of low-noise, low-power analog integrated circuits for the readout of silicon detectors used in high-energy physics and astrophysics experiments. These systems play a key role in enabling precise measurements of particle interactions and cosmic radiation in challenging experimental environments.

I am currently involved in the [General AntiParticle Spectrometer](https://gaps1.astro.ucla.edu/gaps/index.html) (GAPS), a NASA–JAXA–INFN–ASI Antarctic balloon experiment. GAPS is designed to perform the first sensitive search for low-energy cosmic-ray antideuterons, together with precision measurements of antiprotons and antihelium, providing a unique indirect probe of dark matter.

🏔️ Outside the lab, I enjoy exploring the mountains — you can find some of my hikes on [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/it-it/user/4059073076208).
