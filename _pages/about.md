I am a Computer Engineer and a Ph.D. student in microelectronics for high-energy physics at the Department of Engineering and Applied Sciences, [Microelectronics Laboratory](https://microlab-unibg.it/#/home), [University of Bergamo](https://en.unibg.it/). I work as a technologist at the Pavia branch of the Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN) within the CSN2 particle physics division, and I previously served as an associate research fellow at the Astrophysics Laboratory of Columbia University.

My research focuses on the design and characterization of analog integrated circuits for the readout of silicon-strip detectors employed in high energy physics and astrophysics experiments.

I am currently contributing to the development of the [General AntiParticle Spectrometer](https://gaps1.astro.ucla.edu/gaps/index.html) (GAPS) Antarctic balloon experiment as part of the GAPS collaboration, aimed at the search for dark matter.
